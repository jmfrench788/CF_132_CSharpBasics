//Bronze
// For this challenge go ahead and create a list of variables using the following data types: int ,string ,bool ,decimal ,float ,doublie , and ulong . For each of these types, do the following:
// Make at least two examples for each type
// Make one a declaration only
// Declare and initialize the other
// Once you have your variables, go ahead and print some of these values to the console.

int a = 5;
int b;

string greet = "Hi";
string bye;

bool over = false;
bool big;

decimal d = 13.24325m;
decimal dec;

float f = 19.32f;
float fl;

double dd = 23.213d;
double dou;

ulong u = 18432642468;
ulong ul;

System.Console.WriteLine(a);
System.Console.WriteLine(greet);
System.Console.WriteLine(over);
System.Console.WriteLine(d);
System.Console.WriteLine(f);
System.Console.WriteLine(dd);
System.Console.WriteLine(u);

// Concatenate two string variables. If you don't remember how to do that, check the Microsoft Docs here (Links to an external site.).
// Next, try to concatenate a number with a string as well and see what happens.
// Finally, print the results to the console.

//Gold
//Create an  variable to hold a year.
//ask the user to enter a string value that represents a year (whole number)
//The catch for this challenge is that you want to gather the value for the year as an int .
//Your task will be to research how to convert a string to an integer in C#.
// Once you have accomplished this, display the year in the console.
