//Arithmetic operators perform operations with numeric operands

//Addition (+)
// ex. bankAccount +12

//Subtraction (-)
//Ex rations -1

//Multiplication (*)
//ex total*taxPercentage

//Division (/)
//ex markers/studentCount
//This gets how many times the markers can be divided into the variable studentCount

//remainder operator (%)
//ex 10%3 would return 1 (the remainder left over)

//Unary operators
//EX increment++ count up by one, decrement-- decrease by 1

//Assume that studentCount holds a value of 30. 

int studentCount = 30;
studentCount+=1; // or studentCount++

studentCount--; //or studentCount-=1
